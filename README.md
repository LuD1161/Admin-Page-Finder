# Admin-Page-Finder

Well It is needed sometimes ;)

It can search for restricted directories from robots.txt file.

Option to save found links in a text file with well formatted output.

It can search for file types such as PHP,ASP,JS,CGI,CFM,BRF.


Suggest me with new ideas or new links (wherever you find it) to make it better :) .
